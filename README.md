# PlanningGurus
A Django based meta search engine.

About :: Planning Gurus aims to provide real time information of available event management firms in a city, & also make booking of an event with an EMF.

Necessary steps :: 1) keep everything in a virtual env.

2) Keep all the code in a separate folder, let's say 'A' & make another folder names 'static_cdn' in the same path as that of 'A' & run 'python manage.py collecstatic'. Since the site isn't live yet, 'static_cdn' serves as a server for rendering css,script & image files for the time being.
